The description is intended as a summary, and is qualified in its entirety by\\nreference to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 9,241,000,000 shares, consisting of: (i) 5,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.000006 par value per\\nshare; (ii) 4,141,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, $0.000006 par value per share; and (iii) 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.000006 par value\\nper share.\\nCommon Stock\\nDividend Rights\\nSubject to preferences that may apply to shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock are\\nentitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if our board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and only then at the times\\nand in the amounts that our board of directors may determine.\\nVoting Rights\\nThe holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share, and holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share.\\nThe holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Delaware law could\\nrequire either holders of our Class A common stock or our Class B common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:\\n•\\nif we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to\\nincrease or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and\\n•\\nif we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special\\nrights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed\\namendment.\\nStockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and\\nrestated bylaws provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms,\\nwhen the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock. Our directors will be\\nassigned by the then-current board of directors to a class when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the\\ncombined voting power of common stock.\\nNo Preemptive or Similar Rights\\nOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.\\n1' metadata={'source': 'DataRepository/meta10k.pdf', 'file_path': 'DataRepository/meta10k.pdf', 'page': 133, 'total_pages': 147, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001326801-24-000012', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2024-02-02 for the period ending 2023-12-31', 'keywords': '0001326801-24-000012; ; 10-K', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creationDate': \"D:20240202060356-05'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20240202060413-05'00'\", 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4'}\n","page_content='Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions\\nUpon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders\\nof our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if\\nany, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\\nConversion\\nThe outstanding shares of Class B common stock are convertible at any time as follows: (1) at the option of the holder, a share of Class B common stock\\nmay be converted at any time into one share of Class A common stock or (2) upon the election of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of\\nClass B common stock, all outstanding shares of Class B common stock may be converted into shares of Class A common stock.

Once\\nconverted or transferred and converted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock will not be reissued.\\nPreferred Stock\\nSubject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time\\nto time the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its\\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions.

Any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a\\nmajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class until such time as shares of our Class B common stock represent less than\\nthirty-five percent (35%) of the combined voting power of our common stock. This provision could delay or prevent the approval of a change in control\\nthat might otherwise be approved by a majority of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock voting together on a combined basis.\\n•\\nDual Class Stock. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mark\\nZuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if he owns\\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant\\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.\\n•\\nSupermajority Approvals. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not provide that certain\\namendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-\\nthirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. However, when the outstanding shares of our Class B\\ncommon stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate\\nof incorporation or amended and restated bylaws by stockholders will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding\\nshares of Class A and Class B common stock. This will have the effect of making it more difficult to amend our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation or amended and restated bylaws to remove or modify certain provisions.\\n•\\nBoard of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders may\\nfill vacant directorships. When the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of\\ncommon stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant\\ndirectorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors is set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire\\nboard of directors.

Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nAt Meta, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify any areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts\\nand consultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry\\npractices. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management program to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user\\ndata, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-party privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance\\non the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy programs and the supporting control frameworks. These processes support informed risk-based\\ndecision-making and prioritization of cybersecurity countermeasures and risk mitigation strategies. Our risk mitigation strategies include a broad variety of\\ntechnical and operational measures, as well as annual cybersecurity and privacy training for all of our employees.\\nIn addition, we maintain specific policies and practices governing our third-party security risks, including our third-party assessment (TPA) process.\\nUnder our TPA process, we gather information from certain third parties who contract with Meta and share or receive data, or have access to or integrate with\\nour systems, in order to help us assess potential risks associated with their security controls. We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.\\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the\\naudit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for\\nensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement\\nprocesses and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.
